description: Quick task - plan and execute a sub-hour task outside the phase cycle
context: fork
agent: Code
---

<role>
You are the QUICK TASK ORCHESTRATOR. Your job is to plan and execute a small, self-contained task outside the full phase cycle.

Quick tasks are for sub-hour work: bug fixes, small features, config changes, one-off tasks.
They reuse the same planner, executor, and verifier roles but skip research and synthesizer.
</role>

<anti_patterns>
- Do not execute before the user sees the plan preview (Step 3.7 must complete before Step 4)
- Do not proceed past file verification gates if the expected file does not exist on disk — a plan that exists only in conversation context will be lost on compaction
- Do not ask more than 2 approach clarification questions — if the bounded change is still undefined, recommend `/gsdd-new-project`; if the change is defined but 3+ grey areas remain, recommend `/gsdd-plan` instead
- Do not create APPROACH.md for quick tasks — use inline $APPROACH_CONTEXT only
- Do not update ROADMAP.md or SPEC.md from quick tasks — these are phase-level artifacts
- Do not skip config.json reads — workflow toggles (discuss, planCheck, verifier) control flow
- Do not expand scope mid-execution — if the plan reveals architectural work, surface the scope signal (Step 3.6) and let the user decide
</anti_patterns>

<prerequisites>
`.planning/` must exist (from `npx -y gsdd-cli init`, or `gsdd init` when globally installed). ROADMAP.md is NOT required -- quick tasks work during any project phase.

If `.planning/` does not exist, stop and tell the user to run `npx -y gsdd-cli init` first.
</prerequisites>

<repo_root_helper_contract>
All `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs ...` helper commands below assume the current working directory is the repo root. If the runtime launched from a subdirectory, change to the repo root before running them.
</repo_root_helper_contract>

<process>

## Step 1: Get task description

Ask the user: "What do you want to do?"

Store the response as `$DESCRIPTION`. If empty, re-prompt.

---

## Step 2: Initialize

1. Read `.planning/config.json` for workflow toggles and git protocol.
2. Scan `.planning/quick/` for existing task directories. Calculate `$NEXT_NUM` as the next 3-digit number (001, 002, ...).
3. Generate `$SLUG` from `$DESCRIPTION` (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars).
4. Create `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/`.
5. If `.planning/brownfield-change/CHANGE.md` exists, read it first as the current bounded brownfield continuity anchor. Capture the active goal, current posture, next action, and declared write scope as `$BROWNFIELD_CONTEXT`. If `.planning/brownfield-change/HANDOFF.md` exists, read it as supporting judgment context only. Do not let `/gsdd-new-project` become the default fallback when this active change already defines a concrete bounded lane.
6. If `.planning/codebase/` exists, read whichever of `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.planning/codebase/STACK.md`, `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md`, and `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` are present. Summarize key findings from available docs in <=500 words as `$CODEBASE_CONTEXT`, emphasizing: safest surfaces to touch, risky zones to avoid, must-know conventions/traps, and what must be re-verified after change. Note any missing docs in the summary.
7. If `.planning/codebase/` does not exist, build a just-enough inline brownfield baseline instead of stopping. Read the repo root guidance that is cheap and stable (`README.md`, root manifest such as `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` when present, top-level app entrypoints, and any obviously relevant config or module files surfaced by `$DESCRIPTION`). Summarize the findings in <=500 words as `$CODEBASE_CONTEXT`, explicitly labeling it as a provisional baseline and calling out unknowns. Emphasize: likely implementation surface, likely dependency boundaries, conventions already visible, risky areas to avoid touching blindly, and what must be re-verified after the change. If the repo is still too unclear after this pass, keep that uncertainty explicit so Step 3.6 can recommend `/gsdd-map-codebase`.
8. **Session-boundary fallback:** If `.planning/.continue-here.bak` exists, read its `<judgment>` section. Use `<active_constraints>` and `<anti_regression>` rules as task-scoping context (do not violate active constraints; do not regress on listed invariants). After reading, run `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs file-op delete .planning/.continue-here.bak --missing ok` (auto-clean).
9. Inspect the live branch/worktree surface separately from checkpoint or planning artifacts. Run `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs control-map --json` when available and use its computed repo/worktree/planning truth to identify stale/spent branches, dirty tracked/untracked/ignored buckets, sibling or detached worktrees, local annotations, and cleanup obligations. This is advisory for quick tasks unless the mismatch makes the task description materially misleading; local annotations are intent hints, not product truth.

If `.planning/quick/` does not exist, create it along with an empty `LOG.md`:

```markdown
# Quick Task Log

| # | Description | Date | Status | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
```

---

## Step 2.5: Approach clarification (conditional)

Read `.planning/config.json`.
- If `workflow.discuss` is `false` (or key missing): set `$APPROACH_CONTEXT` to empty, skip to Step 3.
- If `workflow.discuss` is `true`: evaluate `$DESCRIPTION` for ambiguity signals.

### Ambiguity signals

| Signal | Detection | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Multiple valid approaches | Description could be solved via distinct patterns | "add caching" (Redis? in-memory? HTTP headers?) |
| Destructive operations | Contains: `delete`, `remove`, `migrate`, `rename`, `replace`, `rewrite`, `drop` | "remove the old auth middleware" |
| Vague scope | Contains: `improve`, `fix`, `update`, `refactor`, `clean up`, `optimize` without specifying target | "improve error handling" |
| Trade-off present | Description implies competing goals (performance vs simplicity, DRY vs explicit) | "make it faster" |

If **no signals fire**: set `$APPROACH_CONTEXT` to empty, skip to Step 3 silently.

If **any signal fires**: identify 1-2 grey areas and ask targeted questions.

### Question format

For each grey area, present 2-3 concrete options with a recommended default:

"I'd approach this with **{recommendation}** because {reason}. Want me to proceed, or do you prefer {alternative}?"

- If user says "go ahead" / "your call" / presses Enter → use the recommendation.
- If user specifies a preference → record it.
- Maximum 2 questions. If the bounded change is still undefined after clarification, recommend `/gsdd-new-project`. If the change is defined but the task still has 3+ grey areas, it's not a quick task — recommend `/gsdd-plan`.

### Output

Store confirmed decisions as `$APPROACH_CONTEXT` — a short string of user-validated choices.
Example: "User confirmed: use in-memory LRU cache, not Redis. Keep existing error format."

No APPROACH.md file is created. This is inline context only.

---

## Step 3: Plan

Delegate to the planner role in quick mode.

<delegate>
**Identity:** Planner (quick mode)
**Instruction:** Read `.planning/templates/roles/planner.md` for your role contract, then create a plan for this quick task.

**Context to provide:**
- Task description: `$DESCRIPTION`
- Approach context: `$APPROACH_CONTEXT` (user-confirmed decisions from Step 2.5 — treat as locked constraints, do not revisit)
- Codebase context: `$CODEBASE_CONTEXT` (existing brownfield codebase summary from codebase maps when they exist, otherwise the inline brownfield baseline from Step 2 — use for orientation and risk awareness, not as hard constraints)
- Mode: quick (single plan, 1-3 tasks, no research phase)
- Output path: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-PLAN.md`

**Constraints:**
- If `$APPROACH_CONTEXT` is non-empty, implement the user's confirmed choices — do not substitute alternatives
- Create a SINGLE plan with 1-3 focused tasks
- Quick tasks are atomic and self-contained
- No research phase, no ROADMAP requirements
- Do NOT extract phase requirement IDs — there is no active phase
- Derive must-haves directly from the task description
- If the quick task is UI-sensitive, include proportional `ui_proof_slots` with slot_id, claim, route_state, required_evidence_kinds, minimum_observations, expected_artifact_types, validation_command, environment, viewport, manual_acceptance_required, and claim_limit; otherwise include a short `no_ui_proof_rationale`
- UI proof slots must be matchable to exact observed evidence later: claim, route/state, observation, evidence kind, artifact path or manual step, privacy metadata, result, and claim limit. Discovery hints from source comments, AST/cAST, semantic search, or Semble-like retrieval do not satisfy proof.
- Observed artifact metadata must include `visibility`, `retention`, `sensitivity`, and `safe_to_publish`; raw screenshots, traces, videos, DOM snapshots, and reports are local-only/unsafe by default. Use `gsdd ui-proof validate <path>` or `gsdd health` when a bundle exists; add `--claim <...>` only for public, publication, tracked, delivery, or release proof use.
- For live rendered UI proof, default to `agent-browser` snapshots/refs, interactions, screenshots, and relevant console/network observations. If unavailable, state the availability constraint and closest project-native interactive browser fallback before narrowing the claim. Existing Playwright/package-script browser tests remain the canonical repeatable regression path when present. The viewport set is plan-owned, but under-specified viewport coverage is weak proof; explain the chosen viewport(s) or narrow the claim limit.
- Keep UI proof proportional: do not scaffold Playwright, Cypress, Cucumber, Storybook, CI, browser MCP, or visual-regression tooling by default
- Ignore <planning_process> Step 1 requirement extraction; use inline goal-backward planning only
- Target minimal context usage

**Output:** `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-PLAN.md`
**Return:** Plan file path and task count.
</delegate>

After the planner returns:

**STOP. Verify that `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-PLAN.md` exists on disk before proceeding to execution. If the file does not exist, report the error to the user and do NOT proceed. A plan that exists only in conversation context will be lost.**

### Quick Plan Self-Check

Before proceeding to execution, verify the plan meets minimum quality:
- [ ] Plan has at least 1 task with `<action>` and `<verify>` sections
- [ ] Each task's `<verify>` has at least one runnable command
- [ ] Plan tasks do not exceed 3 (quick scope constraint)

This is a self-check, not an independent plan-check. Failures are noted but do NOT block execution — report `reduced_assurance` in the completion summary.

---

## Step 3.5: Independent plan check (conditional)

Read `.planning/config.json`.
- If `workflow.planCheck` is `false` (or key missing): skip to Step 3.6.
- If `workflow.planCheck` is `true`: delegate to the plan-checker with quick-scoped dimensions.

<delegate>
**Identity:** Plan Checker (quick mode)
**Instruction:** Read `.planning/templates/delegates/plan-checker.md` for your role contract, then check this quick task plan.

**Context to provide:**
- Task description: `$DESCRIPTION` (treat as the phase goal equivalent)
- Plan: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-PLAN.md`
- Mode: quick

**Constraints:**
- Check 5 dimensions by default: `requirement_coverage`, `task_completeness`, `dependency_correctness`, `scope_sanity`, `must_have_quality`
- If the quick plan contains `ui_proof_slots` or a rendered UI claim, also check `closure_honesty` so weak UI proof slots block execution
- Skip: `key_link_completeness`, `context_compliance`, `goal_achievement`, `approach_alignment`
- Maximum 1 revision cycle (if blockers found, send back to planner once, then accept result)
- Blocker threshold: only block on `task_completeness` or `scope_sanity` violations
- Warnings for other dimensions are noted but do not block

**Output:** Checker response (passed | issues_found) with issue details.
**Return:** Status and issue summary.
</delegate>

If the checker returns `issues_found` with blockers and this is the first cycle:
1. Send the issue list back to the planner for targeted revision of the plan file.
2. Re-run the checker once more.
3. If blockers remain after 1 revision cycle, store `$CHECKER_ISSUES` for display in the plan preview and set `$RISK_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED=true`. Do not execute from default Enter; the user must explicitly accept the known risk in Step 3.7.

If the checker returns `passed`, or `workflow.planCheck` is false, `$CHECKER_ISSUES` is empty and `$RISK_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED=false`.

---

## Step 3.6: Scope signal evaluation

Evaluate the plan against quick-scope boundaries. Read the plan file and check:

| Signal | Threshold | `$SCOPE_WARNING` text |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Files modified | >8 distinct files in plan | "This task touches {N} files — consider `/gsdd-plan` for full ceremony." |
| Architecture keywords in `$DESCRIPTION` | contains: `refactor`, `migration`, `security`, `auth`, `API design`, `schema`, `database` | "This looks like architectural work — consider `/gsdd-plan` for approach exploration." |
| New public APIs | Plan tasks create new route files, API endpoints, or exported interfaces | "New public surface area detected — consider `/gsdd-plan` for approach exploration." |
| Orientation gap | No `.planning/codebase/` exists AND the inline brownfield baseline still cannot name a clear implementation surface, dependency boundary, or safe-to-touch module | "This repo still needs deeper orientation — consider `/gsdd-map-codebase` before changing code." |
| Undefined bounded change | `$DESCRIPTION` still does not identify a concrete bug, feature, target surface, or observable outcome after clarification | "This does not yet describe a bounded change — use `/gsdd-new-project` to define the work first. If `.planning/brownfield-change/CHANGE.md` already defines a concrete bounded lane, treat `/gsdd-new-project` as an intentional widen path rather than the default fallback." |

If any signals fire, concatenate the matching advisory text in the listed order as `$SCOPE_WARNING`. If the undefined bounded change signal fires, keep that advisory first so the routing recommendation stays explicit.
If no signals fire, `$SCOPE_WARNING` is empty.

This is advisory only — it does NOT block execution.

---

## Step 3.7: Plan preview

Present the plan summary to the user before execution begins.

Read the plan file and extract:
- Task count and task names
- List of files to be modified/created (from plan task `<files>` sections)
- A 1-sentence approach summary (first sentence of the plan's objective or goal)

Display:

```
Quick Task Plan Preview:
- Tasks: {count} ({task_names})
- Files: {file_list}
- Approach: {1-sentence summary}
```

If `$SCOPE_WARNING` is non-empty, append:
```
Scope signal: {$SCOPE_WARNING}
```

If `$CHECKER_ISSUES` is non-empty, append:
```
Plan check issues: {$CHECKER_ISSUES}
```

Present options:
- If `$CHECKER_ISSUES` is non-empty: `[type "proceed despite issues" to execute / edit description / abort]`
- Otherwise if `$SCOPE_WARNING` is empty: `[Enter to proceed / edit description / abort]`
- Otherwise if `$SCOPE_WARNING` contains `/gsdd-new-project`: `[Enter to proceed / switch to /gsdd-new-project / edit description / abort]`
- Otherwise if `$SCOPE_WARNING` contains `/gsdd-map-codebase`: `[Enter to proceed / switch to /gsdd-map-codebase / edit description / abort]`
- Otherwise if `$SCOPE_WARNING` is non-empty: `[Enter to proceed / switch to /gsdd-plan / edit description / abort]`

Default-yes applies only when `$CHECKER_ISSUES` is empty. When unresolved checker blockers remain, pressing Enter must not execute; repeat the issues and ask for `proceed despite issues`, `edit description`, or `abort`.

Handle response:
- **Enter (or "yes") when `$CHECKER_ISSUES` is empty:** proceed to Step 4.
- **"proceed despite issues" when `$CHECKER_ISSUES` is non-empty:** proceed to Step 4 and record the explicit risk acceptance in the quick summary.
- **"edit description":** clean up the task directory, then return to Step 1 with `$DESCRIPTION` pre-filled as the starting point.
- **"switch to /gsdd-new-project":** clean up the task directory, then stop quick workflow and report: "Use `/gsdd-new-project` to define or intentionally widen the work into full lifecycle planning. Task description: {$DESCRIPTION}"
- **"switch to /gsdd-map-codebase":** clean up the task directory, then stop quick workflow and report: "Use `/gsdd-map-codebase` for a deeper brownfield baseline before quick work. Task description: {$DESCRIPTION}"
- **"switch to /gsdd-plan":** clean up the task directory, then stop quick workflow and report: "Use `/gsdd-plan` for full ceremony with approach exploration. Task description: {$DESCRIPTION}"
- **"abort":** clean up the task directory, report cancellation, stop.

---

## Step 4: Execute

**Only reached after the user has seen the plan preview in Step 3.7.**

Delegate to the executor role.

<delegate>
**Identity:** Executor
**Instruction:** Read `.planning/templates/roles/executor.md` for your role contract, then execute the quick task plan.

**Context to provide:**
- Plan file: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-PLAN.md`
- Project conventions: `.planning/config.json` (git protocol section)
- Quick task -- do NOT update ROADMAP.md

**Constraints:**
- Execute all tasks in the plan
- Follow advisory git protocol from config.json
- Skip the <state_updates> section of your role contract entirely
- Do NOT update ROADMAP.md phase status or SPEC.md current state
- Create summary at: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-SUMMARY.md`
- If the quick plan defines `ui_proof_slots`, create or update `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/UI-PROOF.md` with fenced JSON containing required top-level fields: `proof_bundle_version`, `scope`, `route_state`, `environment`, `viewport`, `evidence_inputs`, `commands_or_manual_steps`, `observations`, `artifacts`, `privacy`, `result`, and `claim_limits`
- For live UI proof, record `agent-browser` in `evidence_inputs.tools_used` when used, the exact commands or manual ref-based steps, screenshot/report artifact paths, and any relevant console/network observations. If `agent-browser` was unavailable, record that availability constraint and fallback tool explicitly. If existing Playwright tests supplied regression evidence, record the package command and result separately from the `agent-browser` runtime observation.
- Human approval for visual taste, accessibility judgment, baseline acceptance, subjective polish/layout quality, or privacy publication does not replace required `code`, `test`, `runtime`, or `delivery` evidence

**Output:** `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-SUMMARY.md`
**Return:** Summary file path and completion status.
</delegate>

After the executor returns:

**STOP. Verify the SUMMARY file exists at `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-SUMMARY.md` on disk. If it does not exist, report the write failure. Do NOT proceed to verification or LOG.md update without a persisted summary.**

---

## Step 5: Verify (conditional)

Read `.planning/config.json`.
- If `workflow.verifier` is `false`, skip to Step 6.
- If `workflow.verifier` is `true`, delegate to the verifier role:

<delegate>
**Identity:** Verifier (quick mode)
**Instruction:** Read `.planning/templates/roles/verifier.md` for your role contract, then verify the quick task.

**Context to provide:**
- Task description: `$DESCRIPTION`
- Plan: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-PLAN.md`
- Summary: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-SUMMARY.md`

**Constraints:**
- Verify goal achievement against the task description
- Quick scope -- do not check ROADMAP alignment or cross-phase integration
- Write report to: `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-VERIFICATION.md`

**Output:** `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-VERIFICATION.md`
**Return:** Verification status (passed | gaps_found | human_needed).
</delegate>

**STOP. Verify the VERIFICATION file exists at `.planning/quick/$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/$NEXT_NUM-VERIFICATION.md` on disk (when verifier ran). If it does not exist, report the write failure. Do NOT proceed to LOG.md update without a persisted verification report.**

---

## Step 6: Update LOG.md

Append a row to `.planning/quick/LOG.md`:

```markdown
| $NEXT_NUM | $DESCRIPTION | $DATE | $STATUS | [$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG](./$NEXT_NUM-$SLUG/) |
```

Where:
- `$DATE` is today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `$STATUS` is `done` (no verifier), or the verifier's status (passed/gaps_found/human_needed)

---

## Step 7: Report completion

Report to the user:
- Quick task number and description
- Plan path
- Summary path
- Verification path (if verifier ran)
- Status

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] User provided a task description
- [ ] Approach clarification ran (only if workflow.discuss is true AND ambiguity detected)
- [ ] `.planning/quick/` directory exists (created if needed)
- [ ] Task directory created at `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/`
- [ ] `NNN-PLAN.md` created by planner (1-3 tasks)
- [ ] Independent plan check ran (only if workflow.planCheck is true)
- [ ] Plan preview presented to user before execution
- [ ] User confirmed (or pressed Enter) before execution proceeded
- [ ] `NNN-SUMMARY.md` created by executor
- [ ] `NNN-VERIFICATION.md` created by verifier (only if workflow.verifier is true)
- [ ] `LOG.md` updated with task row
- [ ] User informed of completion status
</success_criteria>

<completion>
Report to the user what was accomplished, then present the next step:

---
**Completed:** Quick task #{next_num} — {description}

Created:
- `.planning/quick/{next_num}-{slug}/{next_num}-PLAN.md`
- `.planning/quick/{next_num}-{slug}/{next_num}-SUMMARY.md`
- `.planning/quick/{next_num}-{slug}/{next_num}-VERIFICATION.md` (if verifier enabled)
- Updated `.planning/quick/LOG.md`

**Next step:** `/gsdd-progress` — check project status and continue phase work

Also available:
- `/gsdd-quick` — run another quick task
- `/gsdd-plan` — plan the next phase
- `/gsdd-pause` — save context for later if stopping work

Consider clearing context before starting the next workflow for best results.

</completion>
