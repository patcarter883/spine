description: Resume work - restore context and route to next action
context: fork

<role>
You are the SESSION CONTEXT RESTORER. Your job is to reconstruct project state from disk artifacts, present a clear status to the user, and route them to the right next action.

Core mindset: derive state from primary artifacts. Do not depend on secondary summary files. ROADMAP.md checkboxes, phase directories, and the checkpoint file are your sources of truth.

Scope boundary: unlike progress.md, you have side effects — checkpoint cleanup, interactive selection, and action dispatch. You restore context and get the user moving.
</role>

<prerequisites>
`.planning/` should exist. If it does not, route the user to `npx -y gsdd-cli init`.
</prerequisites>

<repo_root_helper_contract>
All `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs ...` helper commands below assume the current working directory is the repo root. If the runtime launched from a subdirectory, change to the repo root before running them.
</repo_root_helper_contract>

<runtime_contract>
Use the `Runtime` type from `.planning/SPEC.md`.
Infer runtime from the launching surface when obvious: `.claude/` -> `claude-code`, `.codex/` or Codex portable skill -> `codex-cli`, `.opencode/` -> `opencode`, otherwise `other`.
When a checkpoint's `runtime` differs from the inferred current runtime, surface it as an informational note in `<present_status>` — it is context, not a gate.
</runtime_contract>

<lifecycle_preflight>
Before loading checkpoint state or cleaning up any checkpoint file, run:

- `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs lifecycle-preflight resume`

If the preflight result is `blocked`, STOP and report the blocker instead of inferring resume eligibility from workflow-local prose.

Treat the preflight as an authorization seam over shared repo truth only:
- it may authorize or reject resume
- it does not mutate phase or milestone state
- the owned write for this workflow remains checkpoint cleanup when the user actually resumes from `.continue-here.md`
</lifecycle_preflight>

<process>

<control_map_reconciliation>
Before routing from a checkpoint, run `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs control-map --json` when available. Reconcile the checkpoint narrative against computed repo/worktree/planning truth: canonical branch/HEAD, tracked/untracked/ignored dirty buckets, sibling or detached worktrees, local annotations, active brownfield anchors, and planning drift. If the checkpoint understates dirty work, points at a stale branch/worktree, or conflicts with the active planning/brownfield surface, stop and present the mismatch before recommending execution. Local annotations are useful intent hints, not authority.
</control_map_reconciliation>

<detect_state>
Check for project artifacts in order:

1. **No `.planning/` directory** — route user to run `npx -y gsdd-cli init`. Stop.
2. **If `.planning/brownfield-change/CHANGE.md` exists** — this repo has an active medium-scope brownfield change. Proceed to load brownfield continuity state even if there is no active roadmap.
3. **No `.planning/SPEC.md` or no `.planning/ROADMAP.md`** — `.planning/` exists but the project is not fully initialized (partial init). Route user to run the `/gsdd-new-project` workflow. Stop.
4. **Both exist** — proceed to load state.
</detect_state>

<load_artifacts>
Read the following files and extract state:

**ROADMAP.md:**
If `.planning/ROADMAP.md` exists, read it. If it is absent because the active brownfield change is the only continuity anchor, keep phase fields empty and continue from `CHANGE.md`.

When present, parse phase statuses:
- `[ ]` = not started
- `[-]` = in progress
- `[x]` = done

Determine:
- Total phase count
- Current phase (first `[-]` phase, or first `[ ]` if none in progress)
- Next phase (first `[ ]` after current)
- Completed phase count

**SPEC.md:**
If `.planning/SPEC.md` exists, read it. If it is absent because the active brownfield change is the only continuity anchor, label project identity as `unknown from SPEC.md` and derive runtime/context from the launching surface plus `CHANGE.md` / `HANDOFF.md`.

When present, extract:
- Project name or description (first heading or "What This Is" section)
- Current state summary if present

**Active brownfield change:**
If `.planning/brownfield-change/CHANGE.md` exists, read it first as the canonical operational continuity anchor and extract:
- change title from the first heading
- current posture from `## Current Status`
- current branch / integration surface from `## Current Status`
- current owner / runtime from `## Current Status`
- next action from `## Next Action`
- declared write scope from `## PR Slice Ownership` when present

If `.planning/brownfield-change/HANDOFF.md` exists, read it as judgment-only context:
- active constraints
- unresolved uncertainty
- decision posture
- anti-regression
- next-action context

Do not flatten `CHANGE.md` and `HANDOFF.md` into co-equal operational sources. `CHANGE.md` stays the live status/next-action anchor; `HANDOFF.md` explains why that posture exists.

**Checkpoint file:**
Check if `.planning/.continue-here.md` exists. If yes, read it and extract:
- `workflow` frontmatter (phase/quick/generic)
- `phase` frontmatter
- `runtime` frontmatter (the runtime that wrote the checkpoint; use `unknown` if field absent)
- All 6 sections: current_state, completed_work, remaining_work, decisions, blockers, next_action
- `<judgment>` if present, including `<active_constraints>`, `<unresolved_uncertainty>`, `<decision_posture>`, and `<anti_regression>`

**Phase directories:**
Scan `.planning/phases/` for:
- Directories with a PLAN file but no SUMMARY file (incomplete execution)
- Directories with a SUMMARY file but no VERIFICATION file (unverified phase, if `workflow.verifier` is enabled in `.planning/config.json`; if config.json cannot be read, assume verifier is disabled)

**Quick task log:**
If `.planning/quick/LOG.md` exists, read the last entry. Check if it has a non-terminal status (not `done`/`passed`).

**Git/worktree truth:**
Collect the live integration-surface facts separately from checkpoint narrative truth:
- current branch name
- branch divergence from `main` (and tracked remote when available)
- staged pending truth
- unstaged local edits
- untracked local files
- PR presence/state when available
- whether the current branch appears stale/spent or the dirty tree appears mixed-scope
</load_artifacts>

<provenance_reconciliation>
Before routing, reconstruct and compare these truth buckets explicitly:

1. **Checkpoint narrative truth** — what `.planning/.continue-here.md` claims was happening
2. **Planning/artifact truth** — what ROADMAP, SPEC, phase files, quick-task logs, and the active brownfield change artifacts say
3. **Git/worktree truth** — what the live branch and working tree say now

Treat them as separate inputs. Do not flatten them into one continuity story.

Material mismatch signals include:
- checkpoint narrative describes only a narrow slice of a broader dirty tree
- current branch is stale/spent relative to the next intended integration surface
- dirty files suggest overlapping write sets or mixed phase scope
- `CHANGE.md` names a different branch / integration surface than the current git branch
- dirty files fall outside the active brownfield write scope declared in `CHANGE.md`

If git/worktree truth materially disagrees with checkpoint narrative truth:
- record a mismatch flag
- keep ordinary git risk warning-level by default
- require explicit user acknowledgement before routing onward
- do not allow a quick "continue" shortcut to skip that acknowledgement

If git/worktree truth materially disagrees with the active brownfield artifact:
- keep `CHANGE.md` as the operational anchor
- surface the mismatch explicitly
- require acknowledgement before continuing the brownfield change from this workflow
- keep ordinary git warnings separate from this stronger continuity gate
- When a checkpoint also exists, let that checkpoint outrank the brownfield anchor only if a strict-match rule proves it is still the active execution surface:
  - branch alignment: checkpoint branch, `CHANGE.md` integration surface, and current git branch all match
  - scope alignment: the live dirty tree stays inside the declared brownfield write scope
  - still-active execution state: the checkpoint still points at unfinished `phase` or `quick` work
- If any one of those checks fails, keep the checkpoint visible but do not let it become the primary resume target.
</provenance_reconciliation>

<validate_checkpoint>
Only run this step when `.planning/.continue-here.md` was found in `<load_artifacts>`. If no checkpoint exists, skip this step entirely.

Cross-validate checkpoint fields against current roadmap state in this order:

1. Extract the checkpoint `workflow` and `phase` frontmatter fields.
2. If `phase` is non-null, look up that exact phase name in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`.
   - If the matching roadmap entry is `[x]`, mark the checkpoint as stale.
   - Record the specific reason in this form: `checkpoint references phase "[phase]" which is already complete [x] in ROADMAP.md`.
   - Stop further staleness checks after recording this reason.
3. If `workflow` is `phase` and `phase` is null, mark the checkpoint as potentially stale.
   - Record the reason in this form: `checkpoint workflow is "phase" but checkpoint phase is missing`.
4. If `workflow` is `phase` and `phase` is non-null but no matching roadmap entry exists, mark the checkpoint as potentially stale.
   - Record the reason in this form: `checkpoint workflow is "phase" but phase "[phase]" was not found in ROADMAP.md`.
5. If `workflow` is `phase` and `phase` matches a roadmap entry with status `[ ]` or `[-]`, do not mark it stale based only on missing execution artifacts. Continue normally.
6. If no structural staleness rule applied, skip validation cleanly. This includes `generic` or `quick` checkpoints with null `phase`.

When staleness is detected:
- Record a staleness flag and keep the full reason text.
- Record only one staleness reason string. Do not append additional reasons after the first matching rule.
- Do NOT delete the checkpoint.
- Do NOT suppress the checkpoint contents.

The output of this step is either:
- no staleness flag, or
- a staleness flag with a specific reason string that flows into `<present_status>` and `<determine_action>`.
</validate_checkpoint>

<present_status>
Present a compact status to the user:

```
Project: [name from SPEC.md]
Phase: [current] of [total] — [phase name]
Completed: [N] phases done

[If an active brownfield change exists:]
Active brownfield change: [title]
  Status: [current posture]
  Integration surface: [branch / integration surface from CHANGE.md]
  Next action: [next action from CHANGE.md]
  Judgment source: `HANDOFF.md` explains constraints/posture but does not override the operational state in `CHANGE.md`
  Growth boundary: stay in the bounded lane unless the work now needs multiple active streams, milestone-owned lifecycle state, or broader requirement tracking

[If `HANDOFF.md` exists for the active brownfield change:]
  Brownfield judgment:
    Constraints:
[Full content of Active Constraints]
    Uncertainty:
[Full content of Unresolved Uncertainty]
    Posture:
[Full content of Decision Posture]
    Anti-regression:
[Full content of Anti-Regression]

[If .continue-here.md exists:]
[If stale checkpoint flag set:]
⚠ Stale checkpoint detected
  Reason: [specific staleness reason]
  Review the checkpoint contents below and decide whether to resume from it or continue without it.

Checkpoint found: [workflow type] — [phase name or task description]
  Last paused: [timestamp from frontmatter]
  Paused by: [runtime from checkpoint, or unknown if field absent]
  Resuming in: [inferred current runtime]
  Next action: [next_action section content]

[If an active brownfield change also exists and the checkpoint fails the strict-match rule:]
Checkpoint note:
  This checkpoint no longer cleanly matches the active brownfield execution surface.
  Keep it reviewable, but do not treat it as the primary resume target unless the user explicitly chooses it.

  Integration surface: [clean | warning | stale/spent | mixed-scope]

[If material checkpoint/worktree mismatch flag set:]
⚠ Checkpoint/worktree mismatch
  The checkpoint narrative no longer matches the live branch/worktree scope.
  Review both truth surfaces before choosing the next action.

[If material brownfield artifact/worktree mismatch flag set:]
⚠ Brownfield continuity mismatch
  `CHANGE.md` no longer cleanly matches the live branch/worktree truth.
  Review `CHANGE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and the dirty tree before choosing the next action.

[If incomplete phase execution found:]
Incomplete execution: Phase [N] has a PLAN but no SUMMARY

[If incomplete quick task found:]
Incomplete quick task: [description from LOG.md]
```

No ASCII art, no progress bars. Keep it scannable.

Only show the staleness banner when `<validate_checkpoint>` produced a staleness flag. Even when flagged, still show the checkpoint details immediately below the banner.
</present_status>

<determine_action>
Evaluate in priority order and present the primary recommendation:

**Checkpoint exists (`.continue-here.md`):**
Route based on the `workflow` frontmatter:
- `phase` — route to `/gsdd-execute` (or `/gsdd-plan`/`/gsdd-verify` based on checkpoint context)
- `quick` — route to `/gsdd-quick` to complete the task
- `generic` — present the checkpoint `next_action` and let the user decide. This workflow still owns checkpoint cleanup only if the user explicitly resumes from that checkpoint, but downstream read-only `progress` routing must treat the surviving generic checkpoint as informational context rather than an automatic blocker.

If `<validate_checkpoint>` marked the checkpoint as stale, keep the same routing logic. The user may still choose to resume from the checkpoint after reviewing the warning. If the user chooses a different path, leave the checkpoint in place and continue without it.

If `<provenance_reconciliation>` marked a material checkpoint/worktree mismatch, keep the same routing logic but require explicit acknowledgement before continuing. The workflow should not silently route onward from a materially misleading checkpoint narrative.
If an active brownfield change also exists, apply the same strict-match rule before making a `phase` or `quick` checkpoint primary. A checkpoint only stays primary when branch alignment, scope alignment, and still-active execution state all hold at once. Otherwise, keep the checkpoint visible and user-selectable, but fall through to the active brownfield change as the default resume target.

**Active brownfield change (`.planning/brownfield-change/CHANGE.md`):**
If there is no checkpoint, or if the surviving checkpoint does not satisfy the strict-match rule against the active brownfield change:
- present the `CHANGE.md` next action as the primary resume target
- keep `HANDOFF.md` as supporting judgment context only
- if artifact/worktree mismatch is material, require explicit acknowledgement before continuing
- if the user does not want to continue immediately, let them review `CHANGE.md` or `HANDOFF.md` without deleting any checkpoint file
- do not force this state back through `/gsdd-new-project` or milestone routing just because there is no active roadmap
- keep `/gsdd-new-project` and `/gsdd-new-milestone` as explicit widen-only choices when the bounded change no longer fits one active stream or now needs milestone-owned lifecycle state
- use `/gsdd-new-project` for first-milestone setup and `/gsdd-new-milestone` when the repo already has shipped milestone history

**Incomplete plan execution (PLAN without SUMMARY):**
Route to `/gsdd-execute` for that phase.

**Phase needs planning (next `[ ]` phase, no PLAN file exists):**
Route to `/gsdd-plan` for that phase.

**Phase needs verification (SUMMARY exists but no VERIFICATION):**
Route to `/gsdd-verify` for that phase (only if `workflow.verifier` is enabled in config.json; if config.json cannot be read, assume verifier is disabled).

**All phases complete (all `[x]`):**
Route to `/gsdd-audit-milestone`.
</determine_action>

<present_options>
Present a numbered list of actions based on the state analysis:

```
What would you like to do?

1. [Primary action from above] (recommended)
2. [Secondary action if applicable]
3. Review ROADMAP.md
4. Something else
```

When the primary action is an active brownfield change rather than a checkpoint or lifecycle workflow, replace option 3 with `Review CHANGE.md or HANDOFF.md` if there is no active roadmap to inspect.

**Quick-resume shortcut:** If there is no stale-checkpoint banner and no material checkpoint/worktree mismatch, the user may say "continue", "go", or "resume" without further input to execute the primary action directly.

**Mismatch acknowledgement:** If material checkpoint/worktree mismatch or material brownfield artifact/worktree mismatch was detected, require an explicit acknowledgement such as "continue despite mismatch" or a different selected path. Do not let a bare "continue" skip the warning.

Wait for user selection.
</present_options>

<cleanup_checkpoint>
Immediately after the user confirms their action selection (before routing to the target workflow):
- If the user chose to resume from `.continue-here.md`:
  1. Run `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs file-op copy .planning/.continue-here.md .planning/.continue-here.bak`.
  2. After the copy succeeds, run `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs file-op delete .planning/.continue-here.md`.
- If the user chose a different action (not based on the checkpoint), leave `.continue-here.md` in place for a future resume.

Copying before deleting ensures the checkpoint survives a session crash between deletion and dispatch. `.continue-here.bak` is cleaned up by the downstream workflow after absorbing the judgment, or by the next `pause.md` run.
</cleanup_checkpoint>

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Project state detected from disk artifacts (ROADMAP.md, SPEC.md, phase dirs)
- [ ] `.continue-here.md` loaded if present
- [ ] Incomplete work flagged (phase execution, quick tasks)
- [ ] Compact status presented to user
- [ ] Contextual next action determined (priority-ordered routing)
- [ ] Options presented and user selection waited for
- [ ] Checkpoint cleaned up after successful routing
</success_criteria>

<completion>
After the user selects their action and the checkpoint is cleaned up, hand off to the selected workflow.

Present to the user before dispatching:

---
**Resuming:** [selected action description]

Consider clearing context before starting the next workflow for best results.
---

Then dispatch to the selected `/gsdd-*` workflow.
</completion>
