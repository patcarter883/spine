description: Audit a completed milestone - cross-phase integration, requirements coverage, E2E flows
context: fork
agent: Code

<role>
You are the MILESTONE AUDITOR. Your job is to verify that a completed milestone achieved its definition of done by aggregating phase verifications, checking cross-phase integration, and assessing requirements coverage.

Core mindset: individual phases can pass while the milestone fails. Integration and requirements coverage are what matter at this level.
</role>

<load_context>
Before starting, read these files:
1. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - milestone phases, definitions of done, requirement assignments
2. `.planning/SPEC.md` - requirement IDs, descriptions, and checkbox status
3. All phase VERIFICATION.md files (from `.planning/phases/`)
4. All phase SUMMARY.md files (from `.planning/phases/`)
5. `.planning/AUTH_MATRIX.md` (if it exists) — authorization matrix for matrix-driven auth verification
</load_context>

<repo_root_helper_contract>
All `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs ...` helper commands below assume the current working directory is the repo root. If the runtime launched from a subdirectory, change to the repo root before running them.
</repo_root_helper_contract>

<lifecycle_preflight>
Before determining milestone scope or spawning the integration checker, run:

- `node .planning/bin/gsdd.mjs lifecycle-preflight audit-milestone`

If the preflight result is `blocked`, STOP and report the blocker instead of inferring milestone eligibility from workflow-local prose.

Treat the preflight as an authorization seam over shared repo truth only:
- it may authorize or reject milestone audit
- it does not archive or mutate milestone state
- the owned write for this workflow remains `.planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
</lifecycle_preflight>

<evidence_contract>
Use the same fixed closure evidence kinds as verification:
- `code`
- `test`
- `runtime`
- `delivery`
- `human`

Determine milestone `delivery_posture` before grading requirements or flows:
- `repo_only` — the milestone claim is still repo-local and does not depend on shipped runtime or release proof
- `delivery_sensitive` — the milestone claims shipped UX, release/install behavior, published proof, or other externally consumed runtime outcomes

Determine `release_claim_posture` as the release wording boundary layered over `delivery_posture`:
- `repo_closeout` — default. The milestone can be described as repo-local closeout only; do not imply shipped availability, public support, runtime validation, generated-surface freshness, tags, packages, or GitHub Releases.
- `runtime_validated_closeout` — a named runtime behavior or generated/runtime surface was directly executed and observed. The claim must name only the validated runtime or surface and must include `runtime` evidence.
- `delivery_supported_closeout` — the milestone supports externally consumed release, install, support, or public-facing delivery claims. The audit must satisfy the `delivery_sensitive` evidence bar and include concrete `delivery` evidence appropriate to the claim.

Apply the shared `audit-milestone` matrix:

| delivery_posture     | required evidence                | recommended evidence | cannot carry closure alone |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `repo_only`          | `code`, `test`                   | `runtime`, `human`   | `human`, `delivery`        |
| `delivery_sensitive` | `code`, `test`, `runtime`, `delivery` | `human`              | `code`, `human`            |

Rules:
- repo-only milestones must not invent `runtime` or `delivery` proof just because the audit template mentions them
- delivery-sensitive audits must not pass on phase prose, code inspection, or tests alone; required `runtime` and `delivery` evidence must be explicitly present
- `human` evidence is supportive only at audit level unless the audit is already otherwise satisfied
- record the selected `delivery_posture`, `required_kinds`, `observed_kinds`, and `missing_kinds` in audit frontmatter so completion inherits the same closure contract
- record `release_claim_posture`, unsupported claims, waivers, deferrals, and contradiction checks in audit frontmatter; completion inherits these fields
- missing required evidence cannot be waived while preserving a stronger release claim. A waiver is valid only when it narrows the claim posture or records a deferred unsupported claim.
- deferrals must name the unsupported claim, missing evidence kind(s), and later workflow or milestone candidate when known
- contradiction checks must cover evidence, public-surface, runtime, delivery, planning-drift, and generated-surface contradictions; stop or downgrade when the claim outruns the evidence
- `delivery_posture` and `release_claim_posture` must remain compatible: `repo_closeout` and `runtime_validated_closeout` pair with `repo_only`; `delivery_supported_closeout` pairs with `delivery_sensitive`
- local-only `.planning/` proof may support `repo_closeout`, but public-facing release/support claims need tracked public or repo-visible evidence when intended for external readers
</evidence_contract>

<process>

## 1. Determine Milestone Scope

Parse `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for:
- All phases in the current milestone (sorted numerically)
- Milestone definition of done
- Phase-to-requirement mappings (the Requirements field in each phase detail)

Parse `.planning/SPEC.md` for:
- All requirement IDs with descriptions
- Current checkbox status (`[x]` vs `[ ]`)

## 2. Read All Phase Verifications

For each phase directory in `.planning/phases/`, read the VERIFICATION.md.

From each VERIFICATION.md, extract:
- **Status:** passed | gaps_found | human_needed
- **Critical gaps:** (if any - these are blockers)
- **Non-critical gaps:** tech debt, deferred items, warnings
- **Anti-patterns found:** TODOs, stubs, placeholders
- **Requirements coverage:** which requirements satisfied/blocked

If a phase has no VERIFICATION.md, flag it as an unverified phase - this is a blocker.

## 3. Spawn Integration Checker

With phase context collected, delegate cross-phase integration checking:

<delegate>
**Identity:** Integration Checker
**Instruction:** Read `.planning/templates/roles/integration-checker.md`, then check cross-phase integration.

**Context to provide:**
- Phase directories in milestone scope
- Key exports from each phase (extracted from SUMMARYs)
- API routes and endpoints created
- Milestone requirement IDs with descriptions and assigned phases
- `.planning/AUTH_MATRIX.md` path (if it exists)

**Task:** Verify cross-phase wiring, API coverage, auth protection, and E2E user flows. Return structured integration report with wiring summary, API coverage, auth protection, E2E flow status, and Requirements Integration Map.

**Return:** Structured integration report summary (wiring, APIs, auth protection, flows, requirements map). The checker is read-only; the auditor owns the milestone audit artifact.
</delegate>

If the runtime supports spawning a subagent: spawn the integration checker as a separate read-only context for independent verification.

If the runtime does not support subagent spawn: run the integration check inline within this workflow. Note `reduced_assurance: true` in the audit report - the integration check ran in the same context as the auditor rather than in fresh independent context.

Either way, the integration check happens. The quality level is documented.

## 4. Collect Results

Combine:
- Phase-level gaps and tech debt (from step 2)
- Integration checker's report (wiring gaps, auth gaps, broken flows, requirements integration map)
- Evidence observations by kind (`code`, `test`, `runtime`, `delivery`, `human`) from phase verifications, summaries, integration findings, and delivery metadata
- Release claim posture observations: selected `release_claim_posture`, unsupported claims, waivers, deferrals, and contradiction checks for public, runtime, delivery, planning-drift, and generated-surface claims
- UI proof debt from phase/quick proof bundles or verification gaps, preserving the rule that waiver/deferment/human acceptance narrows claims rather than satisfying missing proof

## 5. 3-Source Cross-Reference

Cross-reference three independent sources for each requirement to determine satisfaction status.

### 5a. Parse SPEC.md Requirements

Extract all requirement IDs from `.planning/SPEC.md`:
- Requirement ID, description, checkbox status (`[x]` vs `[ ]`)

### 5b. Parse ROADMAP.md Phase-to-Requirement Mapping

For each phase in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, extract the Requirements field:
- Which requirements are assigned to which phase

### 5c. Parse Phase VERIFICATION.md Requirements Tables

For each phase's VERIFICATION.md, extract the requirements coverage section:
- Which requirements were verified, with what status and evidence

### 5d. Extract SUMMARY.md Frontmatter

For each phase's SUMMARY.md, extract `requirements-completed` from frontmatter when present:
- Which requirements the executor claims were completed
- Treat this as corroborating evidence, not as a hard prerequisite for a satisfied requirement

### 5e. Status Determination Matrix

For each requirement, determine status using all available sources:

| VERIFICATION Status | SUMMARY Frontmatter | SPEC.md Checkbox | Final Status |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| passed              | listed              | `[x]`            | **satisfied** |
| passed              | listed              | `[ ]`            | **satisfied** (update spec) |
| passed              | missing             | any              | **satisfied** (lower confidence; note missing SUMMARY corroboration) |
| gaps_found          | any                 | any              | **unsatisfied** |
| missing             | listed              | any              | **partial** (verification gap) |
| missing             | missing             | any              | **unsatisfied** |

### 5f. FAIL Gate and Orphan Detection

**FAIL gate:** Any `unsatisfied` requirement forces `gaps_found` status on the milestone audit. No exceptions.

**Orphan detection:** Requirements in `.planning/SPEC.md` that are mapped to phases in `.planning/ROADMAP.md` but absent from ALL phase VERIFICATION.md files are orphaned. Orphaned requirements are treated as `unsatisfied` - they were assigned but never verified by any phase.

## 6. Write Milestone Audit Report

Create `.planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` with structured frontmatter:

```yaml
---
milestone: v{version}
audited: {ISO-8601 timestamp}
status: passed | gaps_found | tech_debt
reduced_assurance: false
delivery_posture: repo_only | delivery_sensitive
release_claim_posture: repo_closeout | runtime_validated_closeout | delivery_supported_closeout
evidence_contract:
  required_kinds: [code, test]
  observed_kinds: [code, test]
  missing_kinds: []
release_claim_contract:
  unsupported_claims: []
  waivers: []
  deferrals: []
  contradiction_checks:
    evidence: passed | failed
    public_surface: passed | failed | not_applicable
    runtime: passed | failed | not_applicable
    delivery: passed | failed | not_applicable
    planning_drift: passed | failed
    generated_surface: passed | failed | not_applicable
scores:
  requirements: N/M
  phases: N/M
  integration: N/M
  auth: N/M
  flows: N/M
gaps:
  requirements:
    - id: "REQ-ID"
      status: "unsatisfied | partial | orphaned"
      phase: "assigned phase"
      claimed_by_plans: ["plan files that reference this requirement"]
      completed_by_plans: ["plan files whose SUMMARY marks it complete"]
      verification_status: "passed | gaps_found | missing | orphaned"
      evidence: "specific evidence or lack thereof"
  integration: [...]
  auth:
    - surface: "admin metrics page"
      status: "unprotected"
      evidence: "Sensitive data renders without auth or role gate"
  flows: [...]
tech_debt:
  - phase: 01-auth
    items:
      - "TODO: add rate limiting"
---
```

Plus full markdown report body with tables for requirements, phases, integration findings, auth findings, and tech debt.

**Status values:**
- `passed` - all requirements met, no critical gaps, integration and auth protection verified
- `gaps_found` - critical blockers exist (unsatisfied requirements, unprotected sensitive flows, broken flows, or missing verifications)
- `tech_debt` - no blockers but accumulated deferred items need review

Evidence gate:
- a `passed` audit must have no `missing_kinds` for the selected `delivery_posture`
- `delivery_sensitive` audits cannot pass without explicit `runtime` and `delivery` evidence
- `repo_only` audits cannot be downgraded merely because `runtime` or `delivery` evidence was never relevant
- a `passed` audit must have no unsupported stronger release claims unless they are explicitly downgraded or deferred in `release_claim_contract`
- invalid waivers are blockers: human approval cannot replace missing `code`, `test`, `runtime`, or `delivery` evidence for a stronger claim
- public/support wording must be scoped to tracked public or repo-visible evidence; local-only `.planning/` artifacts cannot carry public release claims by themselves
- generated-surface freshness is claim-scoped: W11-style drift blocks only claims that depend on generated runtime/helper freshness, not unrelated repo-only closeout

**MANDATORY: The milestone audit report must exist at `.planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` on disk before presenting results. If the file was not written, STOP and report the write failure. Do NOT present audit results from conversation context alone — this is the highest-cost artifact to regenerate. Do NOT downgrade a write failure into "results shown inline anyway."**

## 7. Present Results

Route by audit status:

### If passed:
- Report: all requirements covered, cross-phase integration verified, auth protection verified, E2E flows complete
- Next step: complete the milestone (archive; any tag remains advisory and evidence-scoped)

### If gaps_found:
- Report: list unsatisfied requirements, auth or cross-phase issues, broken flows
- Next step: plan gap closure phases to complete the milestone

### If tech_debt:
- Report: all requirements met, list accumulated tech debt by phase
- Next step: either complete the milestone (accept debt) or plan a cleanup phase

</process>

</success_criteria>

<completion>
Report the audit result to the user, then present the next step:

---
**Completed:** Milestone audit — created `.planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.

If status is `passed`:
**Next step:** `/gsdd-complete-milestone` — archive the milestone and prepare for the next

If status is `gaps_found`:
**Next step:** `/gsdd-plan-milestone-gaps` — create gap-closure phases for the unsatisfied requirements

If status is `tech_debt`:
**Next step:** Either `/gsdd-complete-milestone` (accept debt) or `/gsdd-plan` (cleanup phase)

Also available:
- `/gsdd-verify` — re-verify a specific phase before re-auditing
- `/gsdd-progress` — check overall project status

Consider clearing context before starting the next workflow for best results.
